    description: "The first-generation Toyota Venza was introduced as a mid-size crossover wagon targeting the North American market, positioned between the RAV4 and Highlander in Toyota's lineup. Based on the Camry platform but with unique styling and higher ride height, the Venza featured a distinctive design with a sleek roofline, prominent grille, and substantial proportions that blended elements of both wagon and SUV. Available with either a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower or a 3.5-liter V6 generating 268 horsepower, both paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, the Venza prioritized on-road comfort over off-road capability. The five-passenger interior emphasized space and practicality with a wide center console, generous cargo capacity of up to 70.2 cubic feet with rear seats folded, and a focus on versatility for active lifestyles. Feature content was relatively generous even on base models, with higher trims offering leather upholstery, panoramic glass roof, power liftgate, and advanced infotainment options. A minor refresh in 2012 brought updated styling elements and enhanced technology features. The first-generation Venza represented Toyota's attempt to create a segment-blending vehicle appealing to buyers seeking the practicality of an SUV with the driving dynamics and efficiency of a car, though it struggled to establish a clear identity in the marketplace amidst increasing competition from more conventional crossovers. Production ended for the U.S. market in 2015 as Toyota reorganized its crossover lineup, leaving a five-year gap before the nameplate would be revived."

    description: "The second-generation Toyota Venza was reintroduced after a five-year hiatus, now as a distinctly more upscale, style-focused crossover SUV based on the Japanese-market Harrier. Built on Toyota's TNGA-K platform shared with vehicles like the RAV4 and Camry, the new Venza features elegant, almost Lexus-like styling with a sleek silhouette, tapered roofline, and sophisticated design details creating a more premium appearance than most Toyota crossovers. Available exclusively with a hybrid powertrain combining a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with three electric motors (one serving as a starter/generator, one driving the front wheels, and one driving the rear wheels) for a combined 219 horsepower, the Venza delivers an impressive 40 mpg combined fuel economy while providing standard electronic all-wheel drive through its dedicated rear electric motor. The five-passenger interior emphasizes premium materials and technology, with standard features including an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system (12.3-inch available), multi-zone climate control, and power-adjustable front seats, while higher trims offer a unique Star Gaze electrochromic glass roof that can switch between transparent and frosted states. Safety technology is comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 standard across all trim levels, providing features like pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, full-speed dynamic radar cruise control, lane departure alert with steering assist, and automatic high beams. Cargo capacity is modest for the segment at 28.8 cubic feet behind the rear seats, reflecting the Venza's focus on style over maximum utility. The second-generation Venza occupies a specific niche in Toyota's lineup as a more premium, efficiency-focused alternative to the more utilitarian RAV4, appealing to buyers seeking upscale design and technology in a mid-size crossover package without stepping up to the luxury-branded Lexus RX."
